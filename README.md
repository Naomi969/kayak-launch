### User Story
```
GIVEN I am an outdoor enthusiast
THEN I want to be able to easily find hiking trails near cities of my choice.
WHEN I search a city
THEN I want to be able to find multiple hiking trails near that city shown on a map.
WHEN the city is shown
THEN I want to know the current weather at that location.
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I also want that city saved in recent searches so I can quickly see the results again.
